# 📝 Artifact 3 Title: Simple Explanation of Neural Networks

🎯 Objective:
To explain neural networks in the simplest possible way so that non-technical stakeholders can understand how they work, why they are valuable, and how they learn from data.

<img width="800" height="504" alt="Neural-Networks-Architecture" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b0be0dee-4957-4638-81aa-8e48d6face0a" />


⚙️ Process:
1. Break down neural networks into layers: input, hidden, and output.
2. Describe the learning process: prediction → error calculation → adjustment (backpropagation).
3. Use analogies (a “team of tiny learners”) to make concepts relatable.
4. Present visual aids (diagrams of network architecture and learning flow).
5 Conduct an interactive explanation with small, digestible chunks and Q&A.

🛠️ Tools/Materials Used:
- Visual diagrams of neural network architecture and learning process
- Simplified analogies and step-by-step explanations
- Interactive Q&A with stakeholders
- Supporting images to illustrate the flow and team concept

💡 Value Proposition:
- Makes a complex technical concept accessible to non-technical audiences
- Builds stakeholder confidence in AI/ML initiatives
- Aligns expectations on what neural networks can and cannot do
- Encourages informed decision-making on AI adoption by emphasizing the importance of quality data, proper training, and appropriate use cases.

# 📝 Artifact 4 Real-World Data Challenges in Machine Learning: Scenario-Based Problem Solving

This artifact showcases my ability to identify, analyze, and solve real-world data challenges commonly encountered in machine learning workflows. It includes three scenario-based problem-solving exercises focused on:

1. Handling Missing Data: 
   Applied context-aware strategies such as median/mode imputation, regression-based imputation, and missingness analysis (MCAR/MAR/MNAR) to ensure reliable model performance.
2. Managing Imbalanced Classes: 
   Utilized SMOTE oversampling, class-weight adjustments, threshold tuning, and AUC-PR evaluation to properly address rare-event classification and improve accuracy.
3. Detecting & Addressing Data Drift: 
   Implemented drift monitoring using KL divergence and PSI, followed by retraining and continuous monitoring to maintain model performance in real-time environments.

🛠️ Tools Used:
SchoolAI Spaces are collaborative digital environments used throughout the course to interact with AI tools, share content, and work alongside classmates and instructors in real time. Each Space is designed with a specific learning purpose such as brainstorming, scenario practice, reflection, or project development.
