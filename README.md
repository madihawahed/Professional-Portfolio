# 📝 Artifact 3 Title: Simple Explanation of Neural Networks

🎯 Objective:
To explain neural networks in the simplest possible way so that non-technical stakeholders can understand how they work, why they are valuable, and how they learn from data.

<img width="800" height="504" alt="Neural-Networks-Architecture" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b0be0dee-4957-4638-81aa-8e48d6face0a" />


⚙️ Process:
1. Break down neural networks into layers: input, hidden, and output.
2. Describe the learning process: prediction → error calculation → adjustment (backpropagation).
3. Use analogies (a “team of tiny learners”) to make concepts relatable.
4. Present visual aids (diagrams of network architecture and learning flow).
5 Conduct an interactive explanation with small, digestible chunks and Q&A.

🛠️ Tools/Materials Used:
- Visual diagrams of neural network architecture and learning process
- Simplified analogies and step-by-step explanations
- Interactive Q&A with stakeholders
- Supporting images to illustrate the flow and team concept

💡 Value Proposition:
- Makes a complex technical concept accessible to non-technical audiences
- Builds stakeholder confidence in AI/ML initiatives
- Aligns expectations on what neural networks can and cannot do
- Encourages informed decision-making on AI adoption by emphasizing the importance of quality data, proper training, and appropriate use cases.
