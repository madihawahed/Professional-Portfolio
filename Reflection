Reflection: ML vs DL
What I Learned
Key differences between Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL).
ML relies on structured data and feature engineering; DL excels with unstructured data using neural networks.
Hands-on experience with ML algorithms (linear regression, decision trees) and simple DL models (CNNs, feedforward networks).

Challenges Faced
Understanding complex DL architectures like CNNs and RNNs.
Managing computational requirements for training even small DL models.
Fairly comparing performance metrics between ML and DL models.

How I Applied Feedback
Added visualizations (accuracy/loss curves, confusion matrices) to improve clarity.
Focused on practical applications of ML and DL for a more engaging report.
Highlighted limitations of each approach based on reviewer suggestions.

Next Steps for Improvement
Explore advanced DL architectures (e.g., transformers).
Work with larger datasets and real-world scenarios.
Analyze computational efficiency and scalability.
Implement code optimizations for reproducibility.
